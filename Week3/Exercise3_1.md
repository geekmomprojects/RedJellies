# Exercise 3.1

## Investigate Project Board
Look at the documents for the board you are condisering for your final project ([or any ST Discovery Board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32-discovery-kits.html#products)), 
draw the hardware block diagram for the board. For peripherals, note the communication paths (SPI, I2C, etc).

Look at the datasheet for the processor and other documents. Answer these questions:
- What kind of processor is it
- How much Flash and RAM does it have? Any other memory types?
- Does it have any special peripherals? (List 3-5 that you noted as being interesting)
- Does it have a floating point unit?
- If it has an ADC, what are the features?

Look at one application note for this processor.
