#Imaginary Embedded System: Wearable Speech Rate Detector with Haptic Feedback

##Motivation I’m frequently told that I speak quickly, making my words difficult to understand. I’m able to correct the problem when I recognize and focus on it, but it’s challenging to maintain that focus for extended time periods.

##Proposed Solution I would like to create a small, ideally wearable, device, that can analyze my speech in close to real time and provide subtle feedback when the detected rate of spoken words per minute exceeds a specified threshold.

##Implementation
